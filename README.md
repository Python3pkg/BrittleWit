# About

**Brittle Wit is a Twitter Lib for Python.**

- It uses [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), [aiohttp](http://aiohttp.readthedocs.org/en/stable/), and Python 3.5+ (async/await). 
- It is rigorously polite in its adherence to [Twitter's rate limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting). 
- It scales well.
- It works as a library or a server.

## Installation

### As a Library
